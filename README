The power grid model data we used and processed from OpenStreetMap are as followed:

Connection Power Plants-Substations:
This data set contains the power plants connected to the closest substation. We used QGIS to calculate the
distance between the OSM objects. 

Connection Substations-Communities:
This data set contains the communities connected to the closest substation. The substations were filtered
with regard to its attributes of voltage levels.  We used QGIS to calculate the distance. 

Consumption:
Aggregated consumtion, spatially and temporally distributed to individual communities. 

Power Lines:
The power lines are from OSM and (a) provided before processing and (b) after processing them with Python.

(a)Lines total: OSM inferred power lines with 110 kV, 220kV and 380kV voltage levels to model the power grid.
(b)Lines_Splitted_Parameter: Power lines after splitting them into their systems with Python and calculated 
parameters (resistance R, reactance X)

Power Plants:
These data sets contain the inferred OSM objects with regard to power plants. Different OSM keys and values
result in three different data sets. 

Substations:
The substations are provided in two different ways:

(a) Substations Filtered: Contains a filtered data set from the inferred OSM objects with regard to the
voltage level.
(b) Substations Connected: Contains the substations, which were used to connect to the communities.
